There are over twenty guards coming to get you and it is useless to put up a fight. They drag you off to a room at the bottom of the tower and chain you to a wall. To your horror you see the two trolls enter the room. They take it in turns to beat you before passing a sentence of five years' solitary confinement in a dungeon cell. A few minutes later a hunchbacked jailer arrives carrying a bull-hide whip. He fixes a ball and chain to your leg before leading you downstairs to begin your jail sentence. You have failed in your mission. @

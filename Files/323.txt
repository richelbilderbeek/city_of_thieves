The blacksmith looks surprised at your unprovoked aggression and pulls another red-hot iron bar from the fire with his gloved hand. He is very angry and lunges at you with the bar. If the blacksmith wounds you, 3 points from your condition will be removed, because of the burn caused by the iron bar. @

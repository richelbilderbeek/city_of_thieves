Nobody spends a night asleep at Zanbar Bone's tower and lives. In the middle of the night a jet of gas, which poisons you almost immediately, is released from the headboard on the bed. Then Zanbar Bone's witches and servants raise you into an undead world in which you will serve for ever as a spirit stalker. @

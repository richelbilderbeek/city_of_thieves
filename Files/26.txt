You sheathe your sword and look round at the circle of spectators. Having witnessed your excellent swordsmanship each goes quietly back to his table, not wishing to anger you any further. The innkeeper apologises for his unfriendliness and invites you to sit at the bar and enjoy a drink at his expense. You ask him if he knows the whereabouts of Nicodemus. The innkeeper frowns and looks at you inquiringly. Then he says. 'I don't know what you want from that wily old wizard. He keeps himself to himself and lives alone in a small hut under Singing Bridge. Keep walking north along Market Street, through the marketplace, and you'll come to a bridge that crosses Catfish River and leads to the old part of the city and the harbour. Nicodemus won't talk to you and he knows enough magic to keep even the toughest away from his door.' You tell the innkeeper not to be so discourteous to strangers next time, and leave the tavern to head north. @

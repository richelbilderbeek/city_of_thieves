You step back from the vile body of Zanbar Bone, waiting for him to decay. However, you have chosen wrongly! He pulls the arrow from his chest and nibs the compound from his eyes. He sees you and laughs. You are mesmerized by his power and are unable to move. He walks up to you and touches your face with his skeletal fingers. Your life is being quickly drained away, and soon you will begin your undead existence as a servant of Zanbar Bone. @
